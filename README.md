# cypress-demo

## Get Started

we need to run the next command:

*npm install cypress --save-dev*

And we can run Cypress with: **npx cypress open**

## Cypress config

We can consult the types of congifuration here: *https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration*

The most used one are baseUrl (specify wich url:port will be used) and ignoreTestFiles (to keep clean the dashboard without examples test: "\*\*/examples/\*")
